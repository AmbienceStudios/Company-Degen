          <p className='left'>D3G3N is a network of creative and talented people who want and need a safe place to create, collaborate, and network. It was originally founded by Jleewalls with the purpose of learning how to make a profit in the NFT space by degening and representing being a degen. The goal was to have a tower or space that represented what degens are about and onboard users into the metaverse/NFT community.
<br/><br/>
For the time being, D3G3N will be known as an onboarding platform to help users get familiar with the NFTâ€™s and Metaverse while building out the platforms that will be used to create new journeys.</p>
